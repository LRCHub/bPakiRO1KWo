[00:04.83] If You Love Me
[00:05.78] (Written By Marquerite Monnot- Geoff Parsons- Edith Piaf)
[00:34.28] 
[00:10.05] If the sun should tumble from the sky,
[00:18.00] If the sea should suddenly run dry,
[00:24.84] If you love me, really love me,
[00:32.79] Let it happen, I won't care,
[00:40.18] If it seems that ev'ry thing is lost,
[00:47.38] I will smile and never count the cost,
[00:54.28] If you love me, really love me,
[01:02.00] Let it happen, darling I won't care,
[01:12.53] Shall I catch a shooting star?
[01:16.57] Shall I bring it where you are?
[01:20.26] If you want me to, I will,
[01:27.46] You can set me any task,
[01:30.71] I'll do anything you ask
[01:34.44] If you'll only say you love me still,
[01:41.92] When at last our life on earth is through
[01:49.97] I will share eternity with you,
[01:57.11] If you love me, really love me,
[02:04.55] Let it happen, I won't care,
[02:11.78] If you love me, really love me,
[02:19.23] Let it happen, darling, I won't care
